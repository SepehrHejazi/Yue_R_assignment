suggestion: in your data processign you made so many file in the memory which makes your process hard to run and also hard to understand. Also, There is a lack of comments in the discription of the files. line 106-130
suggestion : could use a for loop for creating 1-10 files
data visualization : 
what is area of chromosome? (I guess it is its location?)
Also too many simillar figures. can't tell the difference between the snp density/ area of chromosome figures. all look the same for me.
can't find the hetroginety rates. last data visualization request in the assignemnt. 
conclusion: 
it has a good data processing part but reading the data visualization is kind of hard and last question is unanswered.
